				<h2>What is RedRice?</h2>
				<p><img style = "margin-right: 2.5%;" class = "container-image half left" src = "images/Blood Cells.png">RedRice is a geneticaly modified rice plant series, with added Iron and Vitamin B12 to help reduce Anemia in high risk areas. Using certain species with high concentrations of protein with Iron and Vitamin B12, copying the genes from them that produce these proteins, and adding it to our rice plants, we can create rice that can help reduce iron deficiencies across the world.<br><br>RedRice is currently a designed solution to the Anemia problem. In the image <span class = "desktop">on the left</span> <span class = "mobile">above</span>, the difference in number of blood cells between a normal individual and someone affected by Anemia is astonishing, and over two billion people suffer from some form of Iron Deficiency, which is the main cause of Anemia.</p>
				<p>RedRice is aimed to be a cheaper and more abundant alternative to iron rich food, that is easy to produce and will still provide nutrients. Many foods that are high in iron cannot be produced in large quantities, and cannot grow in certain at-risk areas. Rice can be grown in abundance, as well as being very easy to grow and cheap to buy. With RedRice, not only will there be cheap food in abundance, but it will contain the nessecary nutrients humans need to survive.</p><hr>
				<h2>Why Rice?</h2>
				<p><img style = "margin-left: 2.5%; padding: 5px 40px;" class = "container-image half right" src = "images/Rice & Chopsticks.png">Rice is one of the most universally consumed and abundant food, especially considering it is easy to produce and cheaper than many other foods. It is estimated that rice feeds 21% of the global population. If we can harness this power and use rice as a means to provide much needed nutrients like Iron and Vitamin B12, we can alleviate Anemia almost worldwide.</p>
				<p>Another reason rice is the best possible source for Iron in high-risk areas is it's versatility and ethical tolerance. Unlike some meats and animal products, rice is not a restricted food in many places where other foods may be. Along with that, rice can be used in many ways, and used in many different styles of cooking. As long as people were to consume 7 milligrams of iron from RedRice, Iron Deficiencies and Anemia would be severely reduced.</p><hr>

				<h2>Distribution</h2>
				<p>If RedRice was a real product, it would be distributed both commercially and through humanitarian aid initiatives. Recently, Rice has been growing in price, and due to RedRice's genetic modifications, it may be heavily influenced by these cost changes. As many high-risk areas would not be able to afford higher priced rice, we will work on giving the RedRice to these areas. Even if distribution by land cannot work, due to extreme weather, violence and conflict, or inaccesible roads, we can airdrop 40kg bags of RedRice.</p>
				<p>Commercial sale of RedRice can help us continue distributing and creating RedRice. The cost of creating the first RedRice will likely be close to $136 Million, and we will want to continue to produce RedRice after this.</p><hr>
