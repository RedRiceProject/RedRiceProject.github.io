			<p>The recommended daily intake of iron is approximately 7 mg and RedRice will be able to provide to that need. Although difficult to ascertain the quantity in which certain proteins will become produced, the Vitamin B12, as it is produced through a much longer, complex pathway, will be produced in scant amounts near its recommended daily intake. The Golden Rice Project, in its initial trials, made a crop that would produce Vitamin A at about 1.6 micrograms per gram, while the Vitamin A molecule is both less complex and has a shorter pathway than Vitamin B12. Due to these factors, it is likely that a smaller amount of B12 will be produced. Since the reccomended daily intake for Vitamin B12 varies with age from .4 to 2.8 micrograms daily, it is extremely likely that this will be met. Vitamin B12 is harmless even in extreme concentration (consumption of 60,000 mcg daily has proven harmless in Japanese research) (Treatment with high dose Vitamin B12 been shown to be safe for more than 50 years). As for leghemoglobin, overconsumption of iron can lead to adverse symptoms or the development of free radicals in the bloodstream - but the lower concentrations of Iron in RedRice would be highly unlikely to cause this. About 11 to 27 milligrams of Iron are recommended in diets (Iron Dietary Supplement Fact Sheet). Since only a single gene is required to produce leghemoglobin, this is comparable to the second trial of the Golden Rice Project where only two genes were inserted (allowing greater efficiency and more Vitamin A production). About 37 micrograms per gram of rice were Vitamin A in that trial. Since about 135 to 195 grams of rice are recommended as a daily source of carbohydrates, and about 225 to 325 grams of carbohydrates are recommended for a 2,000 calorie diet, about 12.025 milligrams of iron should be obtained from consumption of RedRice, likely slightly greater (The Recommended Amount & Percent of Carbohydrates Per Day).

			<p>RedRice will help support many in need of jobs. 78% of the worldâ€™s poor live in rural areas and work in agriculture. The cultivation of the is pioneering new crop can help such rural farmers to sell their more valuable crop at higher prices and will be a key contributor in the fight against world poverty. We aspire to have minimal costs for the RedRice seed and allow such rural farmers to cultivate the crop after an initial purchase.</p>
