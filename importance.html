				<h1>The Importance of RedRice</h1>

				<h3>Anemia is a Widespread Issue</h3>
				<p>Anemia affects over two billion people in the world! That's almost a fourth of the entire population! The main cause of Anemia is lack of suffecient red blood cells, which is caused from lack of proper nutrients like Iron and Vitamin B12. If RedRice were to be introduce successfully, it could help hundreds of millions of people, and possibly more, to live a healthier and safer lifestyle, without the risks and problems attributed to Anemia!</p>
				<p>RedRice is a cheap and abundant alternative to Iron rich foods, and can be given to areas in need of these nutrients. With RedRice, we can help reduce the effect of Anemia worldwide and create a healthier and happier population.</p>
				<p>RedRice is only a concept, but the importance of creating ideas, even when there are slim chances of it going from concept to reality, helps us all problem solve, and in the age where problems are everywhere and they need to be fixed, we can only hope that we can solve these problems effectively. RedRice is one of those solutions, and although it may not come to fruition, it can help raise awareness and bring on true change.</p>
