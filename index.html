				<h2>Anemia is a Worldwide Epidemic.</h2>
				<p><img style = "margin-left: 5%" class = "container-image half right" src = "images/WorldSmall.png">Over two billion people suffer a severe lack of healthy red blood cells, or Anemia, due to the deficiency of Iron and Vitamin B12. Especially in poorer areas of the world, the commonality of Iron deficiency is staggering. On the picture<span class = "mobile"> above</span><span class = "desktop"> on the right</span>, the red shows areas that are affected the most by Anemia and Iron dificiencies.</p>
				<p>While there are many foods that can help increase the Iron in our blood, these foods are hard to produce or obtain in poor areas. That is what we are trying to solve with RedRice.</p>
				<h2>What is RedRice?</h2>
				<p>RedRice is one of the first genetically modified food plants to help radically reduce Anemia. Using iron-rich proteins from soybeans and Vitamin B12-rich bacteria, we can effectivly and quickly destribute and grow Rice for areas in need, and fight off the Anemia epidemic. Red in color and easily digestible, RedRice is a cheap alternative to nutrient distribution in third world countries and areas at risk of Iron and Vitamin B12 dificiencies.</p>
