				<h2>Anemia is a Worldwide Epidemic.</h2>
				<p><img style = "margin-left: 5%" class = "container-image half right" src = "images/WorldSmall.png">Over two billion people suffer from anemia, or a lack of red blood cells. This is largely because of Iron and Vitamin B12 deficiences. Especially in poorer areas of the world, the prevalence of Iron deficiency is staggering.<span class = "mobile"> above</span><span class = "desktop"></span></p>
				<p>While many meats can can supply dietary iron, dietary restrictions or poverty prevent many from accesing them. This is the problem we are trying to solve with RedRice.</p>
				<h2>What is RedRice?</h2>
				<p>RedRice is one of the first genetically modified plants that can treat anemia. Red in color and easily digestible, RedRice is a cheap alternative to nutrient distribution in third world countries and areas at risk of Iron and Vitamin B12 dificiencies.</p>
