			<h3>Two Billion People Suffer From Anemia</h3>
			<p>A lack of sufficient red blood cells and reduced capacity to deliver oxygen to body organs. That is the experience two billion people face in the world today. Something needs to be done to stop this epidemic.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>Iron Deficiency is the Primary Cause of Anemia</h3>
			<p>While many foods are Iron rich, they are not mass marketable and easy to produce in lower income societies. To reduce the anemia in the world, a new crop is needed, one that is both easy to mass produce and rich in iron.</p>

			<h2>RedRice is the Solution</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>RedRice is a genetically modified rice plant, that is rich in iron and Micronutrients, which can help solve the Anemia crisis. Leghemoglobin, a form of hemoglobin that is similar to that found in meats, can be found in soybeans which provide the ability to modify rice in a beneficial way. This modified rice, red in color and easily digestible, can be distributed in areas-in-need to alleviate this pressing issue.</p>
